============================================================================

  extsmail 2.1 (2017-11-25)

* Build fix for more recent C compilers.


  extsmail 2.0 (2014-11-12)

* Reload configuration file when SIGHUP is received.

* Added -t option to check a configuration file without running extsmaild.

* Be more careful to free all file handles.


  extsmail 1.9 (2014-06-20)

* Fix bug which could temporarily cause undue CPU to be consumed when a
  large file send was cut off in the middle. This didn't prevent mail being
  sent correctly in the end, but was ugly.


  extsmail 1.8 (2014-05-29)

* Fix bug which caused extsmaild to consume larger amounts of CPU than
  strictly necessary (a normal user should now be able to run extsmaild for
  several days before exceeding 1 second of CPU usage).

* Fix reporting of sent mail on Linux (which previously sent mail correctly,
  but incorrectly reported failure even when the send was successful).

* Various fixes to make OS packager's lives easier.

* Significant code reorganisation to improve readability.


  extsmail 1.7 (2014-03-12)

* Several minor bug fixes spotted by static analysis tools (including
  memory leaks).

* More robust handling of corrupt message files.


  extsmail 1.6 (2012-11-17)

* Time out stalled sendmail processes. If a sendmail process hasn't read or
  written any data for 60 seconds, it is killed and later retried. This
  stops a stalled sendmail from perpetually blocking extsmail. Although
  rare, this could happen e.g. when an interface went down while an SSH
  session was open.


  extsmail 1.5 (2012-07-09)

* Ensure that all messages which can be sent are sent. Some messages may
  temporarily be unsendable (e.g. because of size) and shouldn't hold up
  others.

* Use exponential backoff when retrying. Quite often, a send failure is just
  a brief blip, so retry quickly, and as retries fail, increase the length
  of time until the next retry.

* Add user-configurable notifications for successful / unsuccessful sends.
  Allows users to easily be notified (e.g. via xosd) if mail has been sent
  and, if not, how long it has been since everything was sent.

* Various portability improvements.

* Improvements to batch mode to bring it in line with daemon mode.


  extsmail 1.4 (2011-06-18)

* Minor bug fixes.

* Documentation fixes.


  extsmail 1.3 (2010-05-30)

* OS X compile fixes.

* Fix overly-restrictive configuration permissions check.

* Recover gracefully from some errors that were previously fatal.


  extsmail 1.2 (2009-09-24)

* Fix build error when using bison.

* Minor documentation fixes.


  extsmail 1.1 (2009-04-29)

* Fix two frees of possibly uninitialised pointers.


  extsmail 1.0 (2009-01-05)

* extsmaild's modes are now specified via the "-m <mode name>" switch. In
  particular the behaviour of the "-d" switch is now obtained with
  "-m daemon".

* More intelligent detection of whether a previous instance of extsmaild is
  running or not.

* Systematically use syslog.

* Fix possible race condition between extsmail and extsmaild.

* Correctly handle SIGPIPE.


  extsmail 0.3 (2008-12-11)

* Make Linux support on a par with BSD (using inotify).

* Minor error handling / reporting changes.


  extsmail 0.2 (2008-11-20)

* Adds 'timeout' feature to externals.

* Fixes bug where exec'd externals first parameter was not correctly set.


  extsmail 0.1 (2008-11-11)

* First public release.
