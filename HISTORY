============================================================================

  extsmail 1.6 (2012/11/17)

* Time out stalled sendmail processes. If a sendmail process hasn't read or
  written any data for 60 seconds, it is killed and later retried. This
  stops a stalled sendmail from perpetually blocking extsmail. Although
  rare, this could happen e.g. when an interface went down while an SSH
  session was open.


  extsmail 1.5 (2012/07/09)

* Ensure that all messages which can be sent are sent. Some messages may
  temporarily be unsendable (e.g. because of size) and shouldn't hold up
  others.

* Use exponential backoff when retrying. Quite often, a send failure is just
  a brief blip, so retry quickly, and as retries fail, increase the length
  of time until the next retry.

* Add user-configurable notifications for successful / unsuccessful sends.
  Allows users to easily be notified (e.g. via xosd) if mail has been sent
  and, if not, how long it has been since everything was sent.

* Various portability improvements.

* Improvements to batch mode to bring it in line with daemon mode.


  extsmail 1.4 (2011/06/18)
