.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm extsmail.conf
.Nd configure robust sending of e-mail to external commands
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to configure
.Xr extsmail 1
and
.Xr extsmaild 1 .
It consists of one or more 
.Em key = value
pairs. The following variables are defined:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It spool_dir
Sets the location of the spool directory used by
.Xr extsmail 1
and
.Xr extsmaild 1 .
This is the only variable which must be set in every configuration file.
.It notify_failure_interval
Specifies how often notifications of unsucessful deliveries should be made.
If unspecified, or set to 0, notifications will never be made. Times are
specified as a number followed by
.Em d
(days), 
.Em h
(hours),
.Em m
(minutes), or 
.Em s
(seconds).
.It notify_failure_cmd
The shell command to be executed when
.Em notify_failure_interval
seconds / minutes / hours / days have elapsed since the last fully
successful send cycle. If the string
.Em ${TIME}
exists in the command, it is replaced with a pretty printed string detailing
how much time has elapsed since the last fully successfuly send cycle.
The resulting string is then passed to
.Xr system 3 .
Note that no security checking is (or can be) done on the command, so this
option should be used with caution if a single configuration file serves
multiple users. Please check the warnings that come with
.Xr system 3 .
.It notify_success_cmd
The shell command to be executed when 1 or more messages have been successfully
sent. If the string
.Em ${SUCCESSES}
exists in the command, it is replaced with a string representing the number of
successfully sent messages. The same warnings that apply to
.Em notify_failure_cmd
also apply to this command.
.El
.Sh FILES
The
.Em extsmail
configuration file is searched for, in order, in the following locations:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It ~/.extsmail/conf
Per-user
.Em extsmail
configuration.
.Pp
.It /etc/extsmail/conf
System-wide
.Em extsmail
configuration.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The simplest configuration file looks as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
spool_dir = "~/somewhere"
.Ed
.Pp
A more complex configuration which uses a notification framework to inform the
user of mail sending and failure looks as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
spool_dir = "~/somewhere"
notify_failure_interval = 30m
notify_failure_cmd = "notify-send \-a extsmaild \-c email
  \-i mail-send \-u critical 'extsmaild: ${TIME} since a fully
  successful send cycle'"
notify_success_cmd = "notify-send \-a extsmaild \-c email
  \-i mail-send \-u low 'extsmaild: ${SUCCESSES} messages
  successfully sent'"
